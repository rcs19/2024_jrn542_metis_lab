# MCF Lab: METIS

Control over four parameters
- PNBI Power Neutral Beam Injection 
- $B_T$ toroidal field
- $T_P$ plasma current (poloidal field)
- $\bar{n}$

End goal is to figure out $n_iT_i\tau$ 

we care about 
$n_i$ $T_i$, $\Tau_E$, safety factor, plasma $\beta$, mode-H

Set NBI 2 multiplier = 0

My team run with 1T

P{MW}B{TT}I{MA}N{10^{19} m^{-3}}.mat

### Notes
Can't operate for more than 5 seconds otherwise current will cause melt

Particles putting in aren't considered what does it meaan to increase PNBI? N of particles? Energy of particles? 

Why does confinement time go up?
- Steeper gradient from centre to walls.

More fusion density should decrease?

You are producing graphs because you have questions to answer. 

- 3.5 NBPI output power registers as 0 as investigated by Emir -> no heating whatsoever.
