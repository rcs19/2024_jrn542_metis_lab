# MCF Lab: METIS

We have control over four parameters,
- PNBI Power Neutral Beam Injection 
- $B_T$ toroidal field
- $T_P$ plasma current (poloidal field)
- $\bar{n}$

and our end goal is to figure out the triple product, $n_iT_i\tau$. 

The dependent variables we are interested in are $n_i$, $T_i$ and $\Tau_E$. Other variables we may be interested in is the safety factor, plasma $\beta$, mode-H.

## Scripts
### processing.py
- Original python script provided in Data Lab VLE. Has been edited to pass `datafile` as a function argument instead of using a global variable `full_dataset`.
- Contains functions that read the data files.
- Main function we're interested in is `get_average`.

### main.py 
- This iterates through data files in a specified folder and stores specified variables into a pandas dataframe. Standard deviation is also recorded in this dataframe.
- The ion density `ni0` and triple product `tripleprod` is calculated from the averages (standard deviation is propagated). This dataframe is exported as a `.csv`.

### plot.py
- Uses .csv file generated by main.py to create a stacked plot of chosen variables (with measured `PNBI` in the x-axis).

## Notes
- Set NBI 2 multiplier = 0
- My team run with 1T
- P{MW}B{TT}I{MA}N{10^{19} m^{-3}}.mat

- Can't operate for more than 5 seconds otherwise current will cause melting of solenoid.
- Decrease in density? 
    - Particles being input (PNBI) aren't being considered in ni0. We should ask, what does it meaan to increase PNBI? Is it N of particles, energy of particles? 
    - More fusion so density should decrease?
- Why does confinement time go up?
    - Steeper gradient from centre to walls.
- You are producing graphs because you have questions to answer. 
- 3.5 NBPI output power registers as 0 as investigated by Emir -> no heating whatsoever.
